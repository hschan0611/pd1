 <p>
    You are now beginning <strong>Part 2</strong>.</p>
    <p>The rules and structure are identical to Part 1; however, the payoffs in Part 2 are different. </p>
    <p>Part 2 consists of a sequence of <strong>matches</strong>, and each match is made up of several <strong>rounds</strong>.</p>
    <p>Each match will last for several rounds. After each round, there is a <strong>75% probability</strong> that the match will continue for another round.</p>
    <p>You will interact with the <strong>same participant</strong> throughout a match.</p>
    <p>After a match ends, you will be <strong>randomly rematched</strong> with another participant for the next match.</p>

    <p>Below is the payoff table for Part 2: </p>

    <p><em>Note: In each cell, the first number is <strong>your</strong> payoff and the second number is <strong>the other participant’s</strong> payoff.</em></p>

    <table class="table table-bordered text-center" style="width:auto; margin:auto">
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2" rowspan="2"></th>
      <th colspan="2">The Other Participant</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Action 1</th>
      <th>Action 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th rowspan="2">You</th>
      <th>Action 1</th>
      <td>{{ Constants.both_cooperate_payoff_2 }}, {{ Constants.both_cooperate_payoff_2 }}</td>
      <td>{{ Constants.betrayed_payoff_2 }}, {{ Constants.betray_payoff_2 }}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Action 2</th>
      <td>{{ Constants.betray_payoff_2 }}, {{ Constants.betrayed_payoff_2 }}</td>
      <td>{{ Constants.both_defect_payoff_2 }}, {{ Constants.both_defect_payoff_2 }}</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>
    The rules and procedures are the same as in Part 1; only the <strong>payoffs</strong> have changed. You may refer to the Part 1 instructions in the paper, but please note that the payoffs in Part 2 are different.
